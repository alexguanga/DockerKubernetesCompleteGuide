    "        - But why alpine?\n",
    "        - Preference and compatabilility. We use operating systems that can fulfill our tasks.\n",
    "        - Alpline in specific is being used because it includes a default set of programs that are very useful for creating a Dockerfile\n",

    "- The `build` instructs Docker to tak a Dockerfile and generate an image from it.\n",
    "- The `.` is specifying what is called the **build context**. The build content is the set of files and folders that belong to our project.\n",
    "- It is the set of files and folders that we want to encapsulate or wrap in this container\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "1. `FROM alpine`\n",
    "    - First, it looks if the Base Image is located in the local machine. If not, it downloads the Base Image from Docker Hub. \n",
    "    - There are outputs that specify that the Base Image was appropriate downloaded.\n",
    "2. `RUN apk add --update redis`\n",
    "    - First, there's an ID in the first output from the command above \"Running in ...\". Notice that a few lines below the first output, the output states \"Removing intermediate container ...\". It's the same ID for both outputs.\n",
    "3. `CMD [\"redis-server\"]`\n",
    "    - This step follows a similar procedure to step 2 where a \"Running in ...\" and \"Removing intermediate container...\" is outputted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \"Running in\" & \"Removing intermediate...\"\n",
    "- `FROM alpine` & `RUN apk add --update redis`\n",
    "    - As explained above, the outputs that occur for step 2 and step 3 is a bit strange... (read below to clarify confusion)\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/docker_13.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "    - When the `RUN` command occurs, it backtracks to the previous command. In our case, it's the `FROM` command. Thus, it creates a container with the \"alphine\" Base Image. In the \"alphine\" Base Image, we have the File System (FS) Snapshot\n",
    "    - The `RUN` commands get executed in the Container to run and thus, we should expect new files in the Container's Hardrive (i.e. redis)\n",
    "    - After creating the Container, we remove the Container but we take a system snapshot and we save it as a temporary Image with an ID. \n",
    "    \n",

    "    - <img src=\"./images/docker_14.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/> \n",
    "    - Similar to the previous step, the `CMD` command reverts back one step and thus, used the Base Image that was created in the `RUN` command.\n",
    "    - A slight difference is that it never runs the command \"redis-server\" but if the Base Image is ever runned, it will use the \"redis-server\" command!\n",
